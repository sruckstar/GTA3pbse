# GTA3plugin based speech engine
GTA3pbse (gta3plugin based speech engine) - the script, forcing Claude to speak. YES, IT HAPPENED, Claude learned to talk! He's still not talking in cutscenes, but during gameplay you will hear his voice, which was used in GTA2.

Claude has learnt 13 different phrases and can also burp and fart (press the TAB key).
